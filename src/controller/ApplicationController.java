	 * A method to get the list of the user's activities

	 * A method to remove a chosen activity

	 * To do: Create a skeleton of the controller's methods and decide what parameters they should take (from the front-end)
	 * and what they return (from the back-end).
	 * When this is done it will be easy to divide the project.
